### Hi, I'm Brendan

I guess you could say I want to be a magician.
As Arthur C. Clarke said:

>"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"

One of the greatest joys in my life is taking what once was magic to me and gaining an understanding solid enough to create my own magic.
For as long as I can remember, I've been so interested in how everything around me works.
Throughout my life, I've pursued my desire to truly understandy *why* both within the established education system as well as independently pursuing my interests.
I've dabbled in wood- and metalworking, robotics, and have a formal education in electrical engineering, computer science, and mathematics.
I graduated in 2020 with a MS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Colorado and am now making phased array antennas at [FIRST RF](https://firstrf.com/).

My resume can be found [here]({{base-url}}/assets/resume.pdf).
