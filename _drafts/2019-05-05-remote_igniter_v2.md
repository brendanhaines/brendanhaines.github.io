As a project sponsored by CU's rocketry club, COBRA (now CUSRL), I've been developing a wireless ignition system for high power rockets.

## Design Requirements

The most important requirement is to make something safe which minimizes the possibility for accidental firing as well as misfires. While it is obvious why an early or accidental ignition could have catastrophic consequences, it may be less obvious why a misfire, or dud, could be nearly as bad. In the situation where a rocket is expected to fire but does not ignite, the dangerous situation arises where a person must approach the rocket while it is in an unknown state and has the possibility of catastrophic failure.

One of most foreign requirements for me on this project is the need to make this system entirely stupid-proof. I usually am only anticipating myself using the tools I make but in this case I have to plan ahead for others. It is quite likely that people who know nothing about the inner functioning of this system will have to operate it and be safe in doing so.
