                            Santiago not bleeding could show that his blood did not need to be spilled and could allude to innocence.

                            Shows how the brothers could possibly feel remorse by needing the comfort of naming the pigs, but they are not comfortable enough giving them human names.<br>
                            Also shows the nature of the people in the novel. Pigs and flowers can be replaced easily hence the naming. However, they have little regard to Santiago, a human life which they believe can be easily replaced
