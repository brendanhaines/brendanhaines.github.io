Begin every new post with the following snippet:
```  
---
layout: post
title: Title of your post
categories: [category 1, category 2]
---
```  
`title:` in the above snippet is obviously the title of your post.  
`categories:` A blog category can either be a word or a group of words separated by a comma.  
Choose them wisely and use them to give a gist of the post or post's content.  
`Categories` can play a crucial role in organizing your siteâ€™s posts properly. It is also considered a good SEO practice.  
`Categories` makes it easy for your potential web visitors to navigate around your site and offers a good user experience.
